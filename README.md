# Data Structures in Go

This repository contains my implementation of various core **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** using **Go (Golang)**.
Each data structure is written from scratch to deepen understanding of internal mechanisms and algorithms.

## Implemented Data Structures

- **Linked List**  
  Singly linked list implementation with basic operations such as insertion, and traversal.

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
  Supports insertion, search, deletion, and DFS traversals.

- **Minimum Heap (Min-Heap)**  
  Heap-based priority queue supporting insert and extract-min operations.

- **AVL Tree**  
  Supports insertion, deletion, and In-Order traversal.

- **Graph**  
  Supports adding vertices and edges, performs DFS (Depth-First Search).
